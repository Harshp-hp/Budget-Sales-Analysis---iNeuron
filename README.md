# Conclusion 

1) The Bikes category is the most popular, with Mountain bikes of 200cc being a favorite for off-roading experience. Road bikes of 150cc are also popular.
2) Silver, black, and red are the majority colors providing higher sales in the Bikes category. White and other colors are not contributing as much to sales.
The Clothing category is not as popular, with sales lower than the other two categories.
3) Accessories products play a significant role in profit recovery, contributing to 50% of the profit over the unit price.
4) California and New South Wales are the top two states in terms of sales, generating 5.71 and 3.93 million sales, respectively, with profit margins of 41.48% and 40.66%, respectively.
5) The US is the top-performing country, generating sales of 9.39 million with an overall profit margin of 41.54%. Australia provides sales of 9.06 million on a profit margin of 40.68%. However, sales are really down in Canada, France, and Germany, and the company should investigate the reasons for the decline in sales in these countries.


Based on these insights, the company can focus on promoting the popular colors for the Bikes category and increasing sales in the Clothing category. The company can also analyze the reasons for the decline in sales in Canada, France, and Germany and take corrective measures to improve sales. Additionally, the company can continue to focus on selling Accessories products, which contribute significantly to profit recovery. Additionally, the company can analyze the reasons for the decline in sales in the next year and take corrective measures to avoid it in the future.
